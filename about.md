Bharath received a BA and BS from UC Berkeley in EECS and Mathematics and was valedictorian of his graduating class in mathematics. He is currently a PhD student in computer science at Stanford University whose research focuses on the application of deep-learning to problems in drug-discovery. Bharath is also the lead developer and creater of [deepchem.io](https://deepchem.io) and co-creator of [moleculenet.ai](https://moleculenet.ai).
